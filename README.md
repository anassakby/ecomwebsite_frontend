## üîÑ Data Flow

### Product Data

1. User interacts with search/filter/navigation UI  
2. `ProductsManager` checks cache; fetches from DummyJSON API if needed  
3. Caches product data with timestamp (5-minute expiry)  
4. Renders products dynamically with animation effects  

### Shopping Cart

1. User adds/removes items or adjusts quantities  
2. `ShoppingCart` updates internal state and triggers UI updates  
3. Saves state to `localStorage` for persistence  
4. Updates cart icon and shows confirmation toasts  

### Authentication

1. User opens authentication modal  
2. Credentials validated on client side (simulation)  
3. Creates user session in `localStorage`  
4. Updates UI to reflect logged-in state with personalized features
